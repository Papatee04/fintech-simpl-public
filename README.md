API Endpoints
Here is an example of the API for viewing a user's transaction history:

python
Copy code
@login_required
def view_transaction_history(request):
    user = request.user

    # Fetch transactions for the logged-in user
    transactions = Transaction.objects.filter(sender=user) | Transaction.objects.filter(
        receiver=user).select_related('sender', 'receiver', 'card', 'wallet')

    transaction_history = {
        'transactions': [
            {
                'type': transaction.transaction_type,
                'sender': transaction.sender.username,
                'receiver': transaction.receiver.username,
                'amount': str(transaction.amount),
                'timestamp': transaction.timestamp.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
                'status': transaction.status,
                'additional_info': transaction.get_additional_info(),
            }
            for transaction in transactions
        ],
    }

    return JsonResponse({'status': 'success', 'transaction_history': transaction_history})
The app includes additional admin operations for managing transactions, such as adding, editing, categorizing, and deleting transactions. These operations can be managed via the Django admin dashboard for ease of use.
